/*
Create a base class called shape .Use this class to store two double type values that could be used to
compute the area of figures, Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle from the base shape .
Add to the base class, a member function get_data() to initialise base class data members and another
member function display_area() to compute and display the area of figures. Make display_area () as a virtual function
and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements.
Using these three classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of a triangle or a rectangle interactively and
display the area.
Area of rectangle = x*y
Area of triangle = Â½*x*y
