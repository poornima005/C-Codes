Define a class in C++ with following description:
Private Members
A data member Flight number of type integer
A data member Destination of type string
A data member Distance of type float
A data member Fuel of type float
A member function CALFUEL() to calculate the value of Fuel as per the following criteria
            Distance                                                 Fuel
            <=1000                                                   500
            more than 1000  and <=2000                               1100
            more than 2000                                           2200
Public Members
A function FEEDINFO() to allow user to enter values for Flight Number, Destination, Distance & call function CALFUEL() to calculate the quantity of Fuel.
A function SHOWINFO() to allow user to view the content of all the data members.
